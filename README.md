# View non-printable Unicode Characters (JS)

This repository contains a PHP script rewritten in JS. 

❗️Idea and original source code is available at [Github](https://github.com/BurninLeo/see-non-printable-characters).

This is a JS script to recognize and display Unicode characters that are otherwise invisible.

The tool's target group are software developers and others who step over strange issues when handling text/data inputs. These may be inputs from users, server responses or database contents that the own scripts do no handle as expected. If the reason is not obvious when looking at the input, it may be caused by Unicode characters that are typically invisible.
